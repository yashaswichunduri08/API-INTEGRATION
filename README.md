# DESCRIPTION :

I developed a responsive News Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches live news using the NewsAPI. The app displays the latest headlines from India.When a user clicks on a button, it shows related news articles instantly without reloading the page. Each article is shown in a clean card layout with an image, title, short description, and a link to read the full news. I used CSS Grid to make the layout responsive and easy to read on all devices. This project helped me understand how to work with APIs, fetch real-time data, and build an interactive and user-friendly website.
